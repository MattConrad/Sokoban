Sokoban
=======

Sokoban in ASP.NET MVC, for Visual Studio 2010.

This is a playable version of the Sokoban game (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban).

It's a few years old, using .NET MVC 2.0/jQuery 1.4, and relying on ViewData a lot more than I would today. See the About tab for a little more story.

If you want to try it out, make a fresh VS solution for the project. The game doesn't have any persistence layer and so shouldn't require much tweaking to get it running. If you do get stuck, drop me a note and I'll help you out.
